# RomCom  

## Abstract:
This app randomly generates romance novel covers, allowing the user to generate their own covers, save any cover they choose, and delete the covers they no longer want. The app features a home page, a form in which the user may enter their own data (image, titles, descriptors), and a page where all saved covers may be viewed.<br>
In a world where romance novels are read, and churned out at an incredible pace, there needs to be way to streamline new novel cover creation, thereby getting the product to those who consume it more effectively.

## Installation Instructions:
The open-sourced code is located at https://github.com/Speekins/romcom. Fork the repository (top right hand side), and clone to the local machine by copying the SSH key and entering "git clone [SSH Key]" into the machine's terminal to create a local working repository. Open the application in the default internet browser by typing "open index.html" into the terminal.

## Context:
We are two Turing students currently in the first module (of four). After studying basic programming principles for a week and a half (yes, that's 10 days), we were tasked with creating this application within the span of 5 days. Each day required roughly 3 hours.
